# ðŸ§¬ Cancer Prediction ML Project

This project is a machine learning-powered web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts the likelihood of a patient being diagnosed with cancer based on medical and lifestyle data.

The app is fully interactive, supports instant predictions, downloadable **PDF reports**, a beautiful UI, and is ready for deployment.
